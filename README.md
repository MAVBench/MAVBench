# Welcome to MAVBench 
MAVBench is a framework targetting design and development of Macro Aerial Vehicles for roboticists, sofware and hardware designers. It consists of a closed-loop simulator and an end-to-end application
benchmark suite. A closed-loop simulation platform is needed to probe and understand the intra-system (application data flow) and inter-system (system and environment) interactions in MAV applications
to pinpoint bottlenecks and identify opportunities for hardware and software co-design and optimization. In addition to the simulator, MAVBench provides a benchmark suite, the first of its kind,
consisting of a variety of MAV applications designed to enable computer architects to perform characterization and develop future aerial computing systems. This work is built on top of a host of open
pecially Thanks to Microsoft and University of EHTH zurich


## Building MAVBench and Using it

### System Requirements
**Hardware**:  
+ Jetson TX2  

**Software**:  
+ Ubuntu: 16.04  
+ JetPack: 3.2 (we have only tested our setup with 3.2 but we suspect, it'll work with higher versions as well)  


### How to Build
- git clone  https://github.com/MAVBench/tx2.git
- cd tx2
- source env.bash
- sudo su /root_setup.bash 
- /user_setup.bash
